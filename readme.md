## Onyx4Oryx

Onyx4Oryx is a tiny bit of code dedicated to non-qwerty users of Moonlander and Ergodox's ZSA split keyboards.

It's mission is to facilitate the use of macros, currently only compatible with qwerty keyboards, by translating your foreign keystrokes into qwerty keystrokes so you know what to choose from the menu :-)

**Hope it's helpfull, have fun !**

______

## Using

>>  ヾ(•ω•`)o

Just launch the `Onyx4Oryx.py` file from your command prompt and follow along!

**Requirements:** You'll need to have python3.x installed to make it work ;-)

### How to

>>  (￣y▽￣)╭

Onyx4Oryx could use some help in the layout's collection: **don't hesitate and send your layout as a _one-line string_ according to the pattern from `layouts.txt` if you can't find yours!**

>>  (⌐■_■)

Here is how to format your string:

* Names may contain spaces
* `(xxxx)` follows to be more explicit about the layout
* `"="` (equal sign) follows without spaces
* `row-without-spaces` follows without spaces
* use `"||"` (double pipe)

**example of formatted layout string from `layouts.txt`:**

> `English (qwerty)=`1234567890-=||qwertyuiop[]||asdfghjkl;'#||\zxcvbnm,./`

> * 1st row = `1234567890-=`
> * 2nd row = `qwertyuiop[]`
> * 3rd row = `asdfghjkl;'#`
> * 4th row = `\zxcvbnm,./`
